# Dry Rate Tracker Plugin

A RuneLite plugin that tracks your dry streaks for OSRS raids (Theatre of Blood, Tombs of Amascut, and Chambers of Xeric) using advanced in-game object detection.

## Features

- **Accurate Object Detection**: Uses actual in-game objects (chests, sarcophagus, lights) and varbits for 100% reliable detection
- **No Chat Dependencies**: Works without relying on chat messages, making it more reliable and language-independent
- **Multiple Raid Support**: Tracks ToB, ToA, and CoX with raid-specific detection methods
- **Team vs Personal Drops**: Distinguishes between personal and team unique drops
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Shows current dry streak, total completions, unique drops, longest streak, and average raids per unique
- **Data Persistence**: Your data is saved and persists between game sessions
- **Clean UI**: Sidebar panel with easy-to-read statistics for each raid
- **Manual Reset**: Reset individual dry streaks with confirmation dialogs
- **Flexible Configuration**: Choose whether team drops reset your personal streak

## How It Works

The plugin uses sophisticated detection methods specific to each raid type:

### Detection Methods

**Theatre of Blood:**
- Monitors loot chest object spawning (IDs: 32990-32993)
- Distinguishes between regular and purple (unique) chests
- Detects both personal and team drops
- Uses region ID 12613 to know when you're in ToB

**Tombs of Amascut:**
- Monitors regular chest objects (IDs: 41696, 44786) for normal raid completions
- Monitors sarcophagus wall object (ID: 46221) for unique drops only
- Uses varbit 14373 to determine if sarcophagus contains unique loot
- Uses varbits 14356-14372 to determine if drop is personal vs team
- Uses region ID 14160 to know when you're in ToA

**Chambers of Xeric:**
- Monitors light object spawning (ID: 28848)
- Uses varbit 5456 to determine loot type (1=standard, 2=unique, 3=dust, 4=kit)
- Uses region ID 12889 to know when you're in CoX

### Raid Completion Detection
- Automatically detects when you complete a raid based on loot object spawning
- No longer depends on chat messages like "Your completed [Raid] count is: X"
- Works regardless of game language or chat settings

### Unique Drop Detection
The plugin automatically detects when unique drops are received:

**Theatre of Blood:**
- Scythe of vitur, Ghrazi rapier, Sanguinesti staff
- Justiciar faceguard, Justiciar chestguard, Justiciar legguards
- Avernic defender hilt, Sanguine ornament kit, Holy ornament kit, Sanguine dust

**Tombs of Amascut:**
- Tumeken's shadow, Elidinis' ward
- Masori mask, Masori body, Masori chaps
- Lightbearer, Osmumten's fang

**Chambers of Xeric:**
- Twisted bow, Elder maul, Kodai insignia
- Dragon hunter crossbow, Dinhs bulwark
- Ancestral hat, Ancestral robe top, Ancestral robe bottom
- Dragon claws, Twisted buckler, Twisted ancestral colour kit, Metamorphic dust

## Usage

1. Install and enable the plugin
2. Complete raids as normal - the plugin will automatically detect completions and drops
3. Check your dry streaks in the sidebar panel
4. Configure whether team drops reset your personal streak in settings
5. Use the reset buttons if you need to manually reset a counter

## Configuration

The plugin includes several configuration options:
- **Enable/disable tracking** for individual raids (ToB, ToA, CoX)
- **Show notifications** for dry streaks and unique drops
- **Team drops reset streaks**: Choose whether team member drops reset your personal dry streak
- **Confirmation dialogs** for manual resets

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Installation

1. Build the plugin using the command above
2. The built JAR will be in `build/libs/`
3. Install through RuneLite's plugin hub or load as an external plugin

## Changelog

### v2.0.2 - Critical Detection Fixes
**üêõ Critical fixes for all raid detectors**

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed Detection Issues
- **Fixed TOB detector**: Added missing chest IDs (33086-33090) that actually spawn in the room, simplified detection logic
- **Fixed TOA detector**: Corrected object IDs to use actual spawning objects (29994 for player chest, 46220 for non-purple sarcophagus, 44787/44788 for vault chests)
- **Fixed CoX detector**: Added GameTick event handling to properly detect raid completion - light object spawns on room entry but only becomes active after Olm dies
- **Removed POH test detector**: Cleaned up test components that were no longer needed

#### üîß Performance Improvements
- **Reduced log spam**: Converted verbose logging from info to debug level across all detectors
- **Anti-spam logging**: Implemented smarter logging that only shows essential information
- **Improved completion timing**: All detectors now trigger at the correct moment (chest spawn for TOB/TOA, light activation for CoX)

#### üéØ Detection Accuracy
- **TOB**: Now reliably detects all chest spawns and correctly identifies purple vs regular chests
- **TOA**: Now detects all completion types and properly distinguishes unique drops
- **CoX**: Now properly waits for Olm death before counting completion, preventing false positives

#### üßπ Code Cleanup
- Removed complex party tracking and impostor ID logic that was causing issues
- Simplified all detectors to use direct object ID matching patterns
- Updated UI terminology from "Master Reset" to "Full Reset" for clarity

### v2.0.1 - Bug Fixes and Full Reset
**üêõ Bug fixes and new reset functionality**

#### ‚ú® New Features
- **Full Reset button**: Added a new "Full Reset" button that completely resets all data for a raid type (dry streak, total completions, total uniques, longest dry streak)
- **Average dry streak display**: Added overall average dry streak calculation (total completions √∑ total uniques) to show average raids per unique drop
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved button layout with both Manual Reset and Full Reset options

#### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed manual reset bug**: Manual reset button was incorrectly incrementing unique count instead of just resetting dry streak
- **Fixed ToA detection**: Added detection for regular ToA chest objects (41696, 44786) - previously only detected sarcophagus (purple drops), missing all regular completions
- **Fixed test methods**: Test Unique and bulk test methods now properly increment completion count when simulating unique drops
- Manual reset now properly only resets current dry streak to 0 without affecting other statistics

#### üîß UI Improvements
- Added clear distinction between Manual Reset (dry streak only) and Full Reset (everything)
- Full Reset button has red styling to indicate destructive action
- Enhanced confirmation dialog for full reset with detailed explanation of what gets reset

### v2.0.0 - Object Detection Rewrite
**üöÄ Major Update: Complete detection system overhaul**

#### ‚ú® New Features
- **Object-based detection**: Complete rewrite from chat message parsing to actual in-game object detection
- **Team vs Personal drops**: Plugin now distinguishes between personal and team unique drops
- **Region-based raid detection**: Uses region IDs to automatically detect when you enter/leave raids
- **Raid-specific detection methods**: Each raid type uses its own optimized detection system
- **Team drop configuration**: New setting to choose whether team drops reset your personal streak

#### üîß Technical Improvements
- **100% reliable detection**: No longer depends on chat messages or game language
- **Varbit integration**: Uses game state varbits for accurate unique drop detection
- **Enhanced logging**: Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- **State management**: Improved tracking of raid state and chest handling

#### üèóÔ∏è Detection Method Changes
- **ToB**: Now detects loot chest objects (32990-32993) instead of chat messages
- **ToA**: Now detects regular chest objects (41696, 44786) for completions + sarcophagus wall objects (46221) + varbits (14373) for uniques instead of chat messages  
- **CoX**: Now detects light objects (28848) + varbits (5456) instead of chat messages

#### üêõ Fixes
- Fixed false positives from chat message parsing
- Fixed missed detections due to chat spam or language differences
- Improved accuracy of unique drop detection
- Better handling of team scenarios

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- No longer requires specific chat messages to function
- Detection behavior may be more accurate, potentially showing different dry streak numbers
- Team drop handling now configurable (previously always counted team drops)
